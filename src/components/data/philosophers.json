It does not follow that the first Chancellor of the German Empire may not have been the first Chancellor of the German Empire â€“ that would be a contradiction. Kripke argues that the way that proper names work is that when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of Bismarck, we are talking about what might or might not have been true of that particular person in various situations, whereas when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of, say, \"the first Chancellor of the German Empire\" we <em>could</em> be talking about what might or might not have been true of <em>whoever</em> would have happened to fill that office in those situations."
