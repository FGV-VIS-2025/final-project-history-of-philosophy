    "text": "This project aims to explore the history of philosophy through an <strong>interactive timeline</strong>. In it, philosophers are positioned according to their birth dates, alongside relevant historical events, allowing for a richer contextualization of the evolution of philosophical thought. The experience is enhanced by various interactive features, such as hover effects, search functionality, and filtering options, all designed to facilitate a deeper understanding of the connections between philosophers and their ideas."

When typing a term, a list of philosophers where it appears is shown, along with the number of occurrences. Clicking on a result underlines the term in the relevant text and automatically centers the philosopher in the timeline."
