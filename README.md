# Project Description
In this project, we targeted an audience interested in philosophy. With this focus, we developed a historical webpage that showcases the most prominent philosophers throughout history.

The page features a central timeline displaying various philosophers arranged chronologically, with the height of each element representing the philosopherâ€™s lifespan. Additionally, the timeline highlights the main branches of philosophy: Ethics, Metaphysics, Logic, Epistemology, Politics, and Aesthetics.

When a user hovers over a philosopher, lines appear connecting them to their respective areas of interest. By clicking on a philosopher, the timeline view splits in half, revealing a section with detailed information about the individual: an image, lifespan, philosophical school, fields of study, and a short descriptive text about their contributions.
